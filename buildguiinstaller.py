"""
Build script for packaging the ED Colonization Assistant GUI installer
into a Windows .exe using Nuitka.

This script expects:
- The PySide6-based installer UI to live in `guiinstaller.py`
- The project root to contain:
    - EDColonizationAsst.ico   (application icon)
    - build_payload/           (optional curated payload tree to ship with the installer)
    - LICENSE                  (LGPL-3 text, shown in the About dialog)

It is intended to be run via `uv`, for example:

    uv pip install -r requirements.txt
    uv run python buildguiinstaller.py

The resulting installer executable will be created under `./` (current
directory) with the name `EDColonizationAsstInstaller.exe`.

Nuitka notes:
- We use `--onefile` for a single exe.
- We enable the `pyside6` plugin.
- We use `--jobs=N` where N is the number of logical cores, so that
  C compilation can run in parallel where supported by the toolchain.
