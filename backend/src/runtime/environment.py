"""
Runtime environment description for the packaged and development runtimes.

This module encapsulates the detection of:

- Runtime mode (DEV vs FROZEN) via [`RuntimeMode`](backend/src/utils/runtime.py:1)
  and [`get_runtime_mode()`](backend/src/utils/runtime.py:1).
- A sensible project root directory depending on mode.
- Icon and frontend URL paths used by the runtime tray UI and application shell.

Keeping this logic in a small, focused module helps ensure that
[`runtime_entry`](backend/src/runtime_entry.py:1) remains a thin entrypoint
while the bulk of the environment logic is shared with
[`runtime.app_runtime`](backend/src/runtime/app_runtime.py:1) and its helpers.
