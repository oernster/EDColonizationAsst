"""Application instance locking for single-instance runtime.

This module implements a lightweight, cross-platform, per-user lock that
prevents multiple instances of the Elite: Dangerous Colonization Assistant
from running concurrently for the same OS user.

The lock is based on an OS-level file lock:

- On Windows it uses msvcrt.locking on a per-user lock file under
  %LOCALAPPDATA%\\EDColonizationAsst.
- On POSIX systems it uses fcntl.flock on a file under either
  $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR, $XDG_CACHE_HOME or ~/.cache/EDColonizationAsst.

Operating system file locks are automatically released when the owning
process exits, so stale locks are not an issue under normal crashes or
reboots.
