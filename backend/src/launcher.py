"""
GUI launcher for Elite: Dangerous Colonization Assistant.

This module now acts primarily as a thin entrypoint and façade over the
launcher components defined in
[`runtime.launcher_components`](backend/src/runtime/launcher_components.py:1).

Responsibilities:

- Enforce single-instance behaviour using
  [`ApplicationInstanceLock`](backend/src/runtime/app_singleton.py:1)
  shared with the packaged runtime and tray controller.
- Detect the project root based on this file's location.
- Initialise the Qt application, window icon, and top-level
  [`QtLaunchWindow`](backend/src/runtime/launcher_components.py:97).
- Delegate all detailed initialisation logic to
  [`Launcher`](backend/src/runtime/launcher_components.py:207).

The heavy-weight Qt view and orchestration logic live in the runtime
submodule to keep this entrypoint small and focused.
