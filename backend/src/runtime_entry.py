"""
Runtime entrypoint for the Elite: Dangerous Colonization Assistant.

This module is designed to be used as the main entry when building a
self-contained runtime executable with Nuitka. It now acts as a *thin*
entrypoint that focuses on:

- Single-instance enforcement via ApplicationInstanceLock.
- Crash logging for the packaged runtime.
- Delegation of all runtime orchestration to RuntimeApplication in
  [`runtime.app_runtime`](backend/src/runtime/app_runtime.py:1).

Two runtime modes are supported (as determined by utils.runtime.get_runtime_mode()):

- Development mode (DEV):
  Launched via the regular Python interpreter. Behaviour is delegated to
  the existing launcher window and virtual-environment logic so that the
  developer experience remains unchanged.

- Frozen mode (FROZEN):
  Launched via a Nuitka-built EXE that embeds Python and all backend
  dependencies. In this mode we:
    * Start the FastAPI backend (uvicorn) in-process.
    * Provide a simple Qt tray UI with an "Open Web UI" and "Exit" action.
    * Do NOT rely on any system-wide Python installation.

The actual EXE build step will continue to target this module, e.g.:

    python -m nuitka --onefile --enable-plugin=pyside6 backend/src/runtime_entry.py
