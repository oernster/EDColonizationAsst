Runtime mode detection utilities.

This module centralises the logic for determining whether the application
is running in a regular development environment (Python interpreter +
virtual environment) or as a frozen executable produced by Nuitka.

It is intentionally minimal and side‑effect free so that it can be safely
imported from anywhere in the backend.

    Nuitka (and other freezer tools) set ``sys.frozen`` on the embedded
    Python interpreter. We use that to distinguish between a packaged
    runtime EXE and a regular Python interpreter invocation.

    In some environments the ``sys.frozen`` attribute may not be present
    or may not behave as expected. As a pragmatic fallback we also treat
    any process whose argv[0] is a non-Python ``.exe`` as frozen. This
    covers the typical case where the runtime is launched via the
    Nuitka-built EDColonisationAsst.exe rather than ``python.exe``.
