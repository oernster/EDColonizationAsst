"""Tray controller entrypoint for Elite: Dangerous Colonization Assistant.

This module is now a thin entrypoint that focuses on:

- Enforcing single-instance behaviour using
  [`ApplicationInstanceLock`](backend/src/runtime/app_singleton.py:27),
  shared with the GUI launcher and packaged runtime.
- Creating the top-level Qt application.
- Instantiating the tray controller defined in
  [`runtime.tray_components`](backend/src/runtime/tray_components.py:1).

The heavy-weight tray logic (process spawning, logging, Exit handling) lives
in the runtime submodule to keep this entrypoint small and focused.
