"""Tests for the GUI launcher entrypoint.

These tests exercise the top-level [`main()`](backend/src/launcher.py:441)
function in a controlled way, focusing on:

- Single-instance behaviour using [`ApplicationInstanceLock`](backend/src/runtime/app_singleton.py:1).
- Ensuring that a lock acquisition error does not prevent the launcher from starting.
